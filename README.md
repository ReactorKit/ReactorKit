ReactorKit is a framework for a reactive and unidirectional Swift application architecture. This repository introduces the basic concept of ReactorKit and describes how to build an application using ReactorKit.

You may want to see the [Examples](#examples) section first if you'd like to see the actual code. Visit the [API Reference](http://reactorkit.io/docs/latest/) for code-level documentation.

For an overview of ReactorKit's features and the reasoning behind its creation, you may also check the slides from this introductory presentation over at [SlideShare](https://www.slideshare.net/devxoul/hello-reactorkit).

## Basic Concept

ReactorKit is a combination of [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) and [Reactive Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming). The user actions and the view states are delivered to each layer via observable streams. These streams are unidirectional: the view can only emit actions and the reactor can only emit states.

### Design Goal

* **Testability**: The first purpose of ReactorKit is to separate the business logic from a view. This can make the code testable. A reactor doesn't have any dependency to a view. Just test reactors and test view bindings. See [Testing](#testing) section for details.
* **Start Small**: ReactorKit doesn't require the whole application to follow a single architecture. ReactorKit can be adopted partially, for one or more specific views. You don't need to rewrite everything to use ReactorKit on your existing project.
* **Less Typing**: ReactorKit focuses on avoiding complicated code for a simple thing. ReactorKit requires less code compared to other architectures. Start simple and scale up.

### View

A *View* displays data. A view controller and a cell are treated as a view. The view binds user inputs to the action stream and binds the view states to each UI component. There's no business logic in a view layer. A view just defines how to map the action stream and the state stream.

To define a view, just have an existing class conform a protocol named `View`. Then your class will have a property named `reactor` automatically. This property is typically set outside of the view.

```swift
class ProfileViewController: UIViewController, View {
  var disposeBag = DisposeBag()
}

profileViewController.reactor = UserViewReactor() // inject reactor
```

When the `reactor` property has changed, `bind(reactor:)` gets called. Implement this method to define the bindings of an action stream and a state stream.

```swift
func bind(reactor: ProfileViewReactor) {
  // action (View -> Reactor)
  refreshButton.rx.tap.map { Reactor.Action.refresh }
    .bind(to: reactor.action)
    .disposed(by: self.disposeBag)

  // state (Reactor -> View)
  reactor.state.map { $0.isFollowing }
    .bind(to: followButton.rx.isSelected)
    .disposed(by: self.disposeBag)
}
```

#### Storyboard Support

Use `StoryboardView` protocol if you're using a storyboard to initialize view controllers. Everything is same but the only difference is that the `StoryboardView` performs a binding after the view is loaded.

```swift
let viewController = MyViewController()
viewController.reactor = MyViewReactor() // will not executes `bind(reactor:)` immediately

class MyViewController: UIViewController, StoryboardView {
  func bind(reactor: MyViewReactor) {
    // this is called after the view is loaded (viewDidLoad)
  }
}
```

### Reactor

A *Reactor* is an UI-independent layer which manages the state of a view. The foremost role of a reactor is to separate control flow from a view. Every view has its corresponding reactor and delegates all logic to its reactor. A reactor has no dependency to a view, so it can be easily tested.

Conform to the `Reactor` protocol to define a reactor. This protocol requires three types to be defined: `Action`, `Mutation` and `State`. It also requires a property named `initialState`.

```swift
class ProfileViewReactor: Reactor {
  // represent user actions
  enum Action {
    case refreshFollowingStatus(Int)
    case follow(Int)
  }

  // represent state changes
  enum Mutation {
    case setFollowing(Bool)
  }

  // represents the current view state
  struct State {
    var isFollowing: Bool = false
  }

  let initialState: State = State()
}
```

An `Action` represents a user interaction and `State` represents a view state. `Mutation` is a bridge between `Action` and `State`. A reactor converts the action stream to the state stream in two steps: `mutate()` and `reduce()`.

</p>

#### `mutate()`

`mutate()` receives an `Action` and generates an `Observable<Mutation>`.

```swift
func mutate(action: Action) -> Observable<Mutation>
```

Every side effect, such as an async operation or API call, is performed in this method.

```swift
func mutate(action: Action) -> Observable<Mutation> {
  switch action {
  case let .refreshFollowingStatus(userID): // receive an action
    return UserAPI.isFollowing(userID) // create an API stream
      .map { (isFollowing: Bool) -> Mutation in
        return Mutation.setFollowing(isFollowing) // convert to Mutation stream
      }

  case let .follow(userID):
    return UserAPI.follow()
      .map { _ -> Mutation in
        return Mutation.setFollowing(true)
      }
  }
}
```

#### `reduce()`

`reduce()` generates a new `State` from a previous `State` and a `Mutation`.

```swift
func reduce(state: State, mutation: Mutation) -> State
```

This method is a pure function. It should just return a new `State` synchronously. Don't perform any side effects in this function.

```swift
func reduce(state: State, mutation: Mutation) -> State {
  var state = state // create a copy of the old state
  switch mutation {
  case let .setFollowing(isFollowing):
    state.isFollowing = isFollowing // manipulate the state, creating a new state
    return state // return the new state
  }
}
```

#### `transform()`

`transform()` transforms each stream. There are three `transform()` functions:

```swift
func transform(action: Observable<Action>) -> Observable<Action>
func transform(mutation: Observable<Mutation>) -> Observable<Mutation>
func transform(state: Observable<State>) -> Observable<State>
```

Implement these methods to transform and combine with other observable streams. For example, `transform(mutation:)` is the best place for combining a global event stream to a mutation stream. See the [Global States](#global-states) section for details.

These methods can be also used for debugging purposes:

```swift
func transform(action: Observable<Action>) -> Observable<Action> {
  return action.debug("action") // Use RxSwift's debug() operator
}
```

## Advanced

### Global States

Unlike Redux, ReactorKit doesn't define a global app state. It means that you can use anything to manage a global state. You can use a `BehaviorSubject`, a `PublishSubject` or even a reactor. ReactorKit doesn't force to have a global state so you can use ReactorKit in a specific feature in your application.

There is no global state in the **Action → Mutation → State** flow. You should use `transform(mutation:)` to transform the global state to a mutation. Let's assume that we have a global `BehaviorSubject` which stores the current authenticated user. If you'd like to emit a `Mutation.setUser(User?)` when the `currentUser` is changed, you can do as following:


```swift
var currentUser: BehaviorSubject<User> // global state

func transform(mutation: Observable<Mutation>) -> Observable<Mutation> {
  return Observable.merge(mutation, currentUser.map(Mutation.setUser))
}
```

Then the mutation will be emitted each time the view sends an action to a reactor and the `currentUser` is changed.

### View Communication

You must be familiar with callback closures or delegate patterns for communicating between multiple views. ReactorKit recommends you to use [reactive extensions](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift/blob/master/RxSwift/Reactive.swift) for it. The most common example of `ControlEvent` is `UIButton.rx.tap`. The key concept is to treat your custom views as UIButton or UILabel.

<p align="center">
  <img alt="view-view" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/931655/27789114-393e2eea-6026-11e7-9b32-bae314e672ee.png" width="600">
</p>

Let's assume that we have a `ChatViewController` which displays messages. The `ChatViewController` owns a `MessageInputView`. When an user taps the send button on the `MessageInputView`, the text will be sent to the `ChatViewController` and `ChatViewController` will bind in to the reactor's action. This is an example `MessageInputView`'s reactive extension:

```swift
extension Reactive where Base: MessageInputView {
  var sendButtonTap: ControlEvent<String> {
    let source = base.sendButton.rx.tap.withLatestFrom(...)
    return ControlEvent(events: source)
  }
}
```

You can use that extension in the `ChatViewController`. For example:

```swift
messageInputView.rx.sendButtonTap
  .map(Reactor.Action.send)
  .bind(to: reactor.action)
```

### Testing

ReactorKit has a built-in functionality for a testing. You'll be able to easily test both a view and a reactor with a following instruction.

#### What to test

First of all, you have to decide what to test. There are two things to test: a view and a reactor.

* View
    * Action: is a proper action sent to a reactor with a given user interaction?
    * State: is a view property set properly with a following state?
* Reactor
    * State: is a state changed properly with an action?

#### View testing

A view can be tested with a *stub* reactor. A reactor has a property `stub` which can log actions and force change states. If a reactor's stub is enabled, both `mutate()` and `reduce()` are not executed. A stub has these properties:

```swift
var isEnabled: Bool { get set }
var state: StateRelay<Reactor.State> { get }
var action: ActionSubject<Reactor.Action> { get }
var actions: [Reactor.Action] { get } // recorded actions
```

Here are some example test cases:

```swift
func testAction_refresh() {
  // 1. prepare a stub reactor
  let reactor = MyReactor()
  reactor.stub.isEnabled = true

  // 2. prepare a view with a stub reactor
  let view = MyView()
  view.reactor = reactor

  // 3. send an user interaction programatically
  view.refreshControl.sendActions(for: .valueChanged)

  // 4. assert actions
  XCTAssertEqual(reactor.stub.actions.last, .refresh)
}

func testState_isLoading() {
  // 1. prepare a stub reactor
  let reactor = MyReactor()
  reactor.stub.isEnabled = true

  // 2. prepare a view with a stub reactor
  let view = MyView()
  view.reactor = reactor

  // 3. set a stub state
  reactor.stub.state.value = MyReactor.State(isLoading: true)

  // 4. assert view properties
  XCTAssertEqual(view.activityIndicator.isAnimating, true)
}
```

#### Reactor testing

A reactor can be tested independently.

```swift
func testIsBookmarked() {
  let reactor = MyReactor()
  reactor.action.onNext(.toggleBookmarked)
  XCTAssertEqual(reactor.currentState.isBookmarked, true)
  reactor.action.onNext(.toggleBookmarked)
  XCTAssertEqual(reactor.currentState.isBookmarked, false)
}
```

Sometimes a state is changed more than one time for a single action. For example, a `.refresh` action sets `state.isLoading` to `true` at first and sets to `false` after the refreshing. In this case it's difficult to test `state.isLoading` with `currentState` so you might need to use [RxTest](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift) or [RxExpect](https://github.com/devxoul/RxExpect). Here is an example test case using RxExpect:

```swift
func testIsLoading() {
  RxExpect("it should change isLoading") { test in
    let reactor = test.retain(MyReactor())
    test.input(reactor.action, [
      next(100, .refresh) // send .refresh at 100 scheduler time
    ])
    test.assert(reactor.state.map { $0.isLoading })
      .since(100) // values since 100 scheduler time
      .assert([
        true,  // just after .refresh
        false, // after refreshing
      ])
  }
}
```
